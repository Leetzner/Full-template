# Introduction

This project is my first creation, it´s a fan-website for the Swedish football team Djurgårdens IF.<br>
I wanted a challenge creating this website so I started coding without help from the course-material.<br>
The reason behind this is that´s the way I learn things, by doing and I am here to learn.<br>


# Built with

I´ve used:

* Visual Studio Code
* MS.Paint

# Bugs

### I´ve encounter some bugs, used the Google inspect tool to solve them.
#### The textcontent in my lists weren´t centered.<br>
I learned the hard way that the browser sometimes add a style to text and other things to make it look "better".<br>
This was solved by inspecting the element with the google tool, added the "padding-inline-start: 0%;" to my lists to solve the bug.<br>
<br>
#### My website got squished<br>
When i made my browserwindow smaller the pictures got squished.<br>
This was solved by using "%" instead of "px" to decide the width och the pictures and lists

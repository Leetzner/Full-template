# Introduction

This project is my first creation, it´s a fan-website for the Swedish football team Djurgårdens IF.<br>
I wanted a challenge creating this website so I started coding without help from the course-material.<br>
The reason behind this is that´s the way I learn things, by doing, and I am here to learn.<br>
<br>
This is my first project<br>

# Built with

# Pictures<br>
<br>

### This is the navigation header.<br>
### The diffrent buttons will make you navigate the page easily, the website is a 2 page site.<br>
### The first 4 buttons will scroll you on a single page and the "Ask us" button will navigate you to a form-page.<br>

### I´ve used this picture to create a nice looking footer, I´ve placed it ontop of a rectangular footer in same color to make it blend smoothly.<br>

# Bugs

### I´ve encounter some bugs, used the Google inspect tool to solve them.
#### The textcontent in my lists weren´t centered.<br>
I learned the hard way that the browser sometimes add a style to text and other things to make it look "better".<br>
This was solved by inspecting the element with the google tool, added the "padding-inline-start: 0%;" to my lists to solve the bug.<br>
<br>

#### My website got squished.<br>
When i made my browserwindow smaller the pictures got squished.<br>
This was solved by using "%" instead of "px" to decide the width och the pictures and lists.<br>
<br>
Had a real struggle with this, had the wrong display function on 80% of my CSS, changed from "display-block" to "display-flex".<br>
That pretty much solved my case
#### Media querys.<br>
Didn´t get the hang on it at first, but with alot of googling and looking at forums I am happy with the layout now.
